        <h2>Information about your right of objection under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
        <h3>Right of objection on a case-by-case basis</h3>
        <p>You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the
            processing of personal data concerning you under Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (data processing based on a balance
            of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4
            GDPR.</p>
        <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling legitimate reasons
            for the processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert,
            exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

            privacy policy will then apply to your next visit.</p>
